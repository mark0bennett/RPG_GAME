You walk away victorious, and continue down a sodden old trail into the wild green yonder
The old man in the glowing orb confronts you again
Old Man: 'I have Good News for you'
Old Man: 'Let me show you a trick'
Old Man: 'You can Crit if you use your stats to the fullest'
Old Man: 'If you have an Agility weapon equipped you can crit depending on how high your Intelligence is!'
Old Man: 'If you have an Intelligence weapon equipped you can crit depending on how high your Agility is!'
Old Man: 'Further down the road I have seen a very powerful enemy indeed'
Old Man: 'This enemy will be 4 levels higher than you, so be careful!'
*ZAP* - he's gone
